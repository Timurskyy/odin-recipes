            sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such as meats<br>
            and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.<br>

    <h3>Steps : </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until<br>
                    well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water.<br>
                    Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and<br>
                    2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.<br>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling<br>
                    water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl,<br>
                    combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.<br>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 Sdegrees C).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking<br>
                    dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the<br>
                    ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups<br>
                    meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat<br>
                    layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to<br>
                    prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not<br>
                    touch the cheese.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25<br>
                    minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
